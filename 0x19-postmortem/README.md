Issue Summary
Duration:
Start Time: March 15, 2024, 10:00 AM (UTC)
End Time: March 15, 2024, 12:30 PM (UTC)
Impact:
During the outage, our primary e-commerce platform experienced a 25% reduction in availability, leading to slow response times for users attempting to make purchases.
Root Cause:
The root cause was identified as an unexpected surge in traffic due to a marketing campaign. This sudden influx overwhelmed our servers, resulting in degraded performance.
Timeline
10:00 AM:
Issue detected through automated monitoring, indicating a spike in response times.
10:15 AM:
Operations team received alerts and began an investigation.
10:30 AM:
Initial assumption: server resource constraint. Investigated server logs and CPU usage.
11:00 AM:
Misleading path: Suspected a DDoS attack due to the sudden traffic increase.
11:15 AM:
Escalation to the networking team to analyze network traffic patterns.
11:45 AM:
Issue traced back to a marketing campaign causing a surge in legitimate user traffic.
12:00 PM:
Implemented rate limiting for incoming requests to mitigate the surge.
12:30 PM:
Normal service restored as rate limiting took effect.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The root cause was identified as an unanticipated surge in traffic triggered by a successful marketing campaign. This led to server overload and performance degradation.
Resolution:
To address the issue, we implemented rate limiting on incoming requests, preventing the servers from being overwhelmed. Additionally, we optimized server configurations to handle increased loads more efficiently.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:
Implement dynamic scaling for server resources during traffic surges.
Enhance monitoring for rapid detection of unexpected traffic spikes.
Review marketing campaign impact assessments before launch.
Tasks:
Configure auto-scaling for server resources based on real-time traffic metrics.
Enhance monitoring to trigger alerts for unusual traffic patterns.
Collaborate with marketing teams to forecast and plan for potential traffic surges.
Conduct regular stress testing to simulate and prepare for high-traffic scenarios.

This postmortem provides insights into the recent web stack outage, emphasizing the importance of anticipating the impact of successful marketing campaigns on system resources. By implementing dynamic scaling and enhancing monitoring capabilities, we aim to fortify our infrastructure against future unforeseen surges, ensuring a seamless experience for our users during peak times.
